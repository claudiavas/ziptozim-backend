				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p>In the current digital landscape, older individuals are increasingly vulnerable to online scams, primarily due to their lack of digital skills and knowledge. According to Stats Canada, about 30 percent of seniors do not use the internet (<a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3234155-1&amp;h=2801775578&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww150.statcan.gc.ca%2Fn1%2Fpub%2F11f0019m%2F11f0019m2019015-eng.htm&amp;a=Stats+Canada" class="notion-link-token notion-focusable-token notion-enable-hover" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-token-index="1" tabindex="0"><span class="link-annotation-unknown-block-id--757107775">Stats Canada</span></a>). For those who do, many lack the necessary digital literacy skills to navigate the web confidently. Unfortunately, as reported by the Department of Justice, approximately 10 percent of Canadian seniors who use the internet fall victim to crimes annually, with fraud being the most prevalent offense against this demographic (<a href="https://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/rp-pr/cj-jp/fv-vf/crim/sum-som.html" class="notion-link-token notion-focusable-token notion-enable-hover" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-token-index="3" tabindex="0"><span class="link-annotation-unknown-block-id--1087767746">Department of Justice</span></a>). The most common types of fraud include identity theft, credit and debit card fraud, online scams, as well as phone and door-to-door scams.</p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p>The National Survey on the Mistreatment of Older Canadians conducted a study on financial abuse that was committed by both individuals and service providers. It found that in 2015, financial abuse among seniors could be as high as 2.6%, which represents 244,176 older Canadians (<a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/national-seniors-council/programs/publications-reports/2019-what-we-heard-financial-crimes-harms.html">Government of Canada</a>). In 2018, seniors aged 60 and above reported the top 5 forms of fraud: extortion, service-tech support scams, phishing, personal information, and fake prizes. The number one scam was the romance scam, which accounted for approximately 25% of all losses among seniors, totalling over $9 million (<a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/national-seniors-council/programs/publications-reports/2019-what-we-heard-financial-crimes-harms.html">Government of Canada</a>).</p>
<p>According to the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre&#8217;s 2018 report, seniors (aged 60+) fell victim to Mass Marketing Fraud and identity theft a total of 6,142 times, which accounted for 29% of all reported cases of fraud (<a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/national-seniors-council/programs/publications-reports/2019-what-we-heard-financial-crimes-harms.html">Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre</a>). The loss from MMF alone amounted to over $26 million, while the combined loss from both MMF and identity theft was over $31 million. These numbers were higher than those reported in 2014, which saw 4,195 seniors being victimized by MMF with a total loss of just over $17 million (<a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/national-seniors-council/programs/publications-reports/2019-what-we-heard-financial-crimes-harms.html">Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre</a>).</p>
<p>Experts say the lack of accessible, reliable and affordable internet in rural areas perpetuates the established digital divide and is leaving many Canadians behind. Currently, while 91.4 percent of all Canadians have access to reliable speed, only 62 percent of rural communities do (<a href="https://crtc.gc.ca/eng/internet/internet.htm">CRTC).</a> According to Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada (ISED), in 2018 almost half of Canadian households with an annual income of $30,000 or less did not have access to high-speed internet at home (<a href="https://acorncanada.org/news/national-post-many-canadians-struggle-to-afford-pricey-high-speed-home-internet-in-urban-areas/">Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada</a>). Research has found some low-income people that do have an internet connection end up sacrificing things like food and medication in order to afford it.</p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p>According to Statistics Canada, focusing on Personal Internet use by province and age group, <a href="https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=2210013501&amp;pickMembers%5B0%5D=3.5&amp;cubeTimeFrame.startYear=2018&amp;cubeTimeFrame.endYear=2020&amp;referencePeriods=20180101%2C20200101">those aged 65+ in Quebec have 64.4% internet use</a>. As of 2021, <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/480874/quebec-weekly-internet-usage-reach/">82 percent of adults in Quebec accessed the internet several times per day, and a further nine percent used the internet about once per day</a>, bringing the share of daily online users in Quebec to about 90 percent of the population. As for adults aged 75+ in Quebec, <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/480892/quebec-weekly-internet-usage-reach-age/">64% use the internet once per day as of 2021.</a> However, <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/480892/quebec-weekly-internet-usage-reach-age/">24% of adults 75+ in Quebec don’t know how to use the internet, 11% use it once per day, and 1% only use it a few times a week or less.</a></p>
<p>According to Statistics Canada, Personal Internet use by province and age group shows that in Quebec, individuals aged 65 and over have a 64.4% internet usage rate (<a href="https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=2210013501&amp;pickMembers%5B0%5D=3.5&amp;cubeTimeFrame.startYear=2018&amp;cubeTimeFrame.endYear=2020&amp;referencePeriods=20180101%2C20200101">Stats Canada</a>). As of 2021, 82% of adults in Quebec accessed the internet several times a day, with an additional 9% using the internet about once per day (<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/480874/quebec-weekly-internet-usage-reach/">Statista</a>). This brings the share of daily online users in Quebec to about 90% of the population. Regarding adults aged 75 and over in Quebec, 64% use the internet once per day as of 2021, while 24% do not know how to use the internet, 11% use it once per day, and 1% only use it a few times a week or less (<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/480892/quebec-weekly-internet-usage-reach-age/">Statista</a>). These statistics matter because they shed light on the digital divide that exists between different age groups and regions in Canada. Specifically, the statistics highlight the relatively low internet usage rates among seniors, especially those aged 75 and over, and the challenges they face in accessing digital resources. This is particularly concerning given the risk of online scams and fraud that seniors face due to their lack of digital skills and knowledge. The use of offline resources, such as the UNI device, can help address this issue and provide a secure way for seniors to learn and engage with digital content.</p>
<p>Even in nursing homes, there is a lack of internet access for seniors. This not only deprives them of the opportunity to connect with loved ones but also limits their access to the wealth of knowledge and information available on the internet. A study revealed that only 14% of nursing homes in a national chain provided computers for residents to use, and 11% had internet access (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17511333/">Tak, Beck, and McMahon</a>). This lack of access to technology perpetuates the digital divide that exists between different age groups and regions in Canada, leaving many seniors vulnerable to online scams and fraud.</p>
<p>Through our meeting with various community leaders, we were quite surprise to realize that this issues was such an important one in North America. While UNI was mostly deployed in countries from the global south, our team was compelled to see if a device like UNI that we deployed in small villages in Africa, could be used in nursing homes, in rural Canada. UNI can help enhance the digital literacy for populations in low connectivity areas, as well as for those that want to have a secure way to learn how to use the internet. Populations in low connectivity areas often face limited or unreliable internet access. UNI addresses this challenge by serving as a local hotspot, allowing users to access offline resources without relying on a stable internet connection. By bridging the connectivity gap, UNI provides individuals in these areas with a practical solution to engage with digital content and develop digital literacy skills. UNI&#8217;s primary feature of making offline resources available ensures that learners have a wide range of educational materials at their fingertips, even without an active internet connection. This is especially beneficial for individuals who are new to the internet and want to gain familiarity with online tools and resources gradually.</p>
<p>UNI can be a valuable tool for seniors aged 65 and over who are looking to develop their digital literacy skills in a safe and secure environment. By providing offline resources, UNI allows seniors to gain familiarity with online tools and resources gradually, without the risk of falling victim to online scams and fraud. Additionally, UNI&#8217;s controlled learning environment allows seniors to explore online resources within a confined space, minimizing exposure to potential online risks. Non-profit organizations working with this population can use UNI as a tool to support their mission. For example, they can use UNI to provide digital literacy training to seniors in low connectivity areas, where internet access is limited or expensive. By providing access to offline resources, UNI can reduce the financial barrier to digital literacy and make it more accessible and affordable for seniors in these areas. Additionally, non-profits can use UNI to promote community sharing and collaboration, where seniors can exchange knowledge and resources and collectively build digital literacy skills.</p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p>Since UNI is portable, it can be shared among individuals or within communal spaces. This sharing model encourages collaborative learning, where individuals can exchange knowledge, share resources, and collectively build digital literacy skills. UNI fosters a sense of community empowerment and engagement with technology. UNI offers a cost-effective approach to digital literacy. In areas where internet connectivity is scarce or expensive, relying solely on online resources can be financially burdensome. UNI eliminates the need for continuous internet access by providing offline resources. This not only reduces the financial barrier but also makes digital literacy more accessible and affordable for populations in low connectivity areas.</p>
<p>UNI provides a controlled learning environment by allowing users to access the internet through a local offline hotspot. This means that learners can explore and experiment with online resources within a confined and secure space, minimizing exposure to potential online risks such as malware, phishing attacks, or inappropriate content. By using UNI as a local offline hotspot, learners can also minimize the exposure of their personal information and browsing history to external entities. This enhanced privacy and data security create a safe learning environment where individuals can freely explore the internet without concerns about their personal information being compromised. Moreover, UNI can be preloaded with curated offline resources and applications specifically designed for learning purposes. These resources can be carefully selected to provide structured and guided learning experiences, catering to various educational needs and levels. Users can explore these resources at their own pace, building confidence and proficiency in using internet-based tools and platforms.</p>
<p>Overall, UNI can be a valuable tool for seniors looking to develop their digital literacy skills and stay safe online. Non-profit organizations can use UNI to support their mission of helping seniors in low connectivity areas gain access to digital resources and develop digital literacy skills.</p></div>

						<div class="et_pb_blurb_description"><p>The ongoing conflict in Ukraine has profoundly impacted the country&#8217;s education system. The conflict has forced the closure of schools, displaced teachers and students, and left many children without access to education</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>According to UNICEF, over 2,600 schools have been damaged or destroyed since the conflict started, leaving only 25% of nationwide schools accessible for in-person learning. 3.6 million children have been affected by school closures, particularly in conflict-affected areas.</strong></p>
<p>To combat this, extensive work must be done to provide children access to distance learning opportunities through educational resources and support., including school kits, books, and learning materials. Additionally, implementing programs to support mobile education and distance learning, reaching children in areas where schools are closed or inaccessible, is crucial.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the digital divide, where many children lack access to technology or the internet, can worsen existing inequalities, leaving the most vulnerable children behind. UNICEF addresses this challenge by providing children with digital devices, establishing internet hotspots in communities and schools, and training teachers and parents to support digital learning. <strong>To find out more about the education crisis in Ukraine, visit the UNICEF website at the links below.</strong></p>

<p>Our Web Scraper tool has entered into<span> </span><span><strong>BETA</strong></span>! After 3 semesters efforts and involvement of 13 students from Central Connecticut State University, Web Scraper is now ready for use! If you haven’t heard about Project Web Scraper, then get ready! This browser extension allows you to<span> </span><span><strong>access websites offline, in one click</strong></span>, allowing you to easily capture entire websites. This is particularly useful for individuals who may not have reliable access to the Internet, or who want to be able to access content even when they don&#8217;t have a Wi-Fi or cellular connection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our goal with Project Web Scraper is to make web browsing much<span> </span><span><strong>more convenient and accessible,</strong></span><span> </span>especially for people who don&#8217;t always have access to the internet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We&#8217;re actively seeking feedback from users to help us improve the tool and make it more effective. If you&#8217;re interested in trying out the Web Scraper tool, visit the<span> </span><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/project-web-scraper/dlmkfombgglclffcecdmiaejgkfibppa?utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_3vD70Znbl9umpfB-i1UymzJi6UEXdsJGPY5pzqlIL_CN1hiH-rZ2khBjBE-MbvW77wzRO" data-hs-link-id="0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chrome Store</a></p>

<p><strong>📙Blog</strong></p>
<p>Within Q2, we published 3 blog posts that centre around technology in education and nonprofits and technology. Our most recent blog post discussed MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) within Africa. In Africa, the use of MOOCs is still relatively new, and not many African countries perceive them as tools for boosting higher education access. To read more, visit our blog<span> </span><a href="https://www.grey-box.ca/blog/potential-of-moocs/?utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_3vD70Znbl9umpfB-i1UymzJi6UEXdsJGPY5pzqlIL_CN1hiH-rZ2khBjBE-MbvW77wzRO" data-hs-link-id="0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our recent blog posts were produced by various interns as part of our Work Integrated Learning (WIL) experience we offer! Thanks to McGill University and the University of Canada West for providing us with great student interns. As part of a WIL partnership, our interns gain invaluable learning experiences and opportunities for personal and professional growth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During their time with us, the students are immersed in projects that revolve around various social issues such as the digital divide, education inequality, youth empowerment and more. Through these projects, they learn how to collaborate with diverse teams, communicate effectively, and navigate the challenges that arise when dealing with real-world problems. Moreover, our interns and volunteers get to engage directly with the communities we serve, allowing them to witness the impact of their efforts firsthand. This exposure fosters empathy, cultural sensitivity, and a deeper understanding of the root causes of social issues. They learn that sustainable solutions require not only immediate interventions but also long-term strategies that address systemic problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our WIL partnership with McGill University and the University of Canada West is a testament to our commitment to nurturing the next generation of change makers.</p>
<p>Through these experiences, students not only enhance their skills, but also learn about social issues and their complexities. We are grateful to be part of this journey and look forward to continuing to empower young minds to make a positive impact on the world.</p>

They are an Ukraine based non-profit that helps youth to reach their successful future through non-formal education. We deployed 2 of our UNI devices with them over the past few months. After spending some time working with the devices, they got back to us and shared some valuable feedback!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here’s what Tetiana had to say about UNI:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the notable advantages is its versatile connectivity options, which go beyond the conventional laptop connection. We want to highlight that the device can be conveniently connected also to power banks. This capability provides us with increased flexibility and convenience in various scenarios. With the ability to connect the device to a power bank, we can enjoy uninterrupted functionality and mobility, even in situations where a laptop or traditional power source is not readily available. This feature proves to be particularly useful in outdoor settings or during power outages, ensuring continuous operation and usage.</p>

						<div class="et_pb_blurb_description"><p>MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) are online courses that are free, easily accessible, and have no entry requirements. They have been designed to make higher education accessible to everyone, everywhere, particularly in regions where participation in higher education is low. However, in Africa, the use of MOOCs is still relatively new, and not many African countries perceive them as tools for boosting higher education access.</p>
<p>A study based on 15 peer-reviewed research papers published between 2013 and 2020 found that MOOCs are mostly used as a self-learning element to support formal qualifications within African universities. They are used as supplementary courses or designed to provide extra tuition support to students already in the system. This means that MOOCs only cater to a limited number of learners and do not address the existing education access divide.</p>
<p>Moreover, most people from African countries taking MOOCs already possess some level of higher education, and many learners and teachers at high school level are not even aware of what MOOCs are due to lack of access to digital spaces.</p>
<p>Some African countries, including Nigeria, Egypt, and South Africa, have acknowledged the role that MOOCs might play in broadening higher education access, but this has not yet been translated into national policy.</p>
<p>To widen access to higher education through MOOCs, higher education institutions in African countries need to initiate dialogue with governments and accreditation bodies. Governments must also raise awareness among stakeholders, including school communities, educationists in higher education, policy makers, and government stakeholders, to provide African students with quality and relevant education.</p>

						<div class="et_pb_blurb_description"><p>The COVID-19 pandemic has transformed how we live and work; education is no exception. With social distancing measures in place, educators and students worldwide were forced to shift to online learning platforms. While many were already used to it, <strong>the sudden shift to digital education has brought a host of challenges, particularly for those unfamiliar with online learning platforms.</strong></p>
<p>This situation is even more challenging in developing countries like South Africa, with most students not adept at finding their way around the internet and many lecturers lacking the skills and knowledge to facilitate online classes effectively. To explore the impact of educators&#8217; skills, knowledge, and experience in e-learning on student support, a recent study focusing on an open-distance e-learning institution in South Africa was conducted, putting the participants under a training program designed to boost their digital skills. The study also solicited feedback from students&#8217; discussion forums to see how their learning experiences differed when their lecturers were technologically adept versus when they were not.</p>
<p>The study found that before completing the training program, most lecturers lacked the knowledge and digital skills necessary for open-distance e-learning, negatively impacting their attitudes toward using technology in their teaching and for student support. <strong>However, the skill-building program significantly improved their digital literacy and positively shifted their perspectives. This suggests that educational institutions should offer their staff continuous professional development in distance education and e-learning</strong> to improve the quality of students&#8217; learning subsequently. Nowadays, some of the most common e-learning methods imparted in corporate training include web-based learning such as Learning Management Systems, virtual classrooms, video modules with human instructors, mobile learning, etc. In addition, the study recommends using surveys to assess academic staff&#8217;s readiness for online teaching and create a platform for them to share information and their training program experiences.</p>
<p>Moreover, I<strong>nstitutions must train their staff to adopt and adapt to new technologies effectively for better teaching and improved student learning outcomes.</strong> The study also highlights the importance of engaging students creatively through digital platforms, such as discussion forums, which is essential to foster a collaborative learning environment. Nevertheless, access to technology and the Internet is a significant challenge in developing countries like South Africa, hindering educational opportunities. Universities can help provide access to these resources. Still, more needs to be done to address the digital divide, such as investing in infrastructure, improving internet access in remote and rural areas, and exploring innovative solutions in schools like mobile learning. According to Ernst &amp; Young, governments will play a key role in bridging the digital divide and boosting digital transformation. <strong>Some solutions to this challenge for the educational sector include affordable, robust broadband internet service, internet-enabled devices that meet user needs, and access to digital literacy training.</strong></p>
<p>Overall, the study&#8217;s findings highlight the importance of investing in faculty development and skills-building programs to improve the quality of online education, particularly in developing countries where access to technology and the Internet may be limited, ensuring education becomes more accessible and inclusive.</p></div>

						<div class="et_pb_blurb_description"><p>The Covid-19 pandemic has brought unique challenges to the nonprofit world. Protocols such as social distancing and stay-at-home orders have disrupted many nonprofit plans and programs. In response, nonprofits have embraced technology as means to overcome new challenges. A dominant trend has been an increase in the use of ICTs (Information and Communication Technology) such as websites, emails, social media, chat, and video conferencing software. They have been useful in connecting nonprofit workers, volunteers, donors, and recipients in their activities. However, the benefits of ICTs have not been distributed equally around the world. The global digital divide has excluded peoples who do not have universal access to reliable internet. It is thus, important that nonprofits pay attention to how ICT trends can be used to serve everyone.</p>
<p><strong>Impacts of Covid-19</strong></p>
<p>The <em>Nonprofit Technology Trends</em> report, conducted by Sage Intacct, highlight the five biggest impacts of Covid-19 on nonprofits:</p>
<ol>
<li>Program disruptions</li>
<li>Challenges shifting to a remote work</li>
<li>Innovations from virtual environment</li>
<li>Decrease in funding</li>
<li>Increased demand for services</li>
</ol></div>

						<div class="et_pb_blurb_description"><p>The Covid-19 pandemic has brought nonprofits waves of constant change and uncertainty. They have been experienced not only by nonprofits, but also their donors, supporters, and recipients. With forced closures, extended periods of remote work, and very inconsistent reopening plans, the need for adjustment have become crucial for nonprofits to carry on their work.</p>
<p><strong>Recent ICT Trends</strong></p>
<p>The <em>Global NGO Technology Survey,</em> also conducted by Nonprofit Tech for Good, showed that in 2021:</p>
<ul>
<li>32% of NGOs use internal communications software such as Slack</li>
<li>79.3% of NGOs use video conferencing software such as Zoom</li>
</ul></div>

						<div class="et_pb_blurb_description"><p>It is seen in the above reports that nonprofits worldwide have been rapidly expanding their use of technology with an increased reliance on them. ICTs such as the web, email, social media, internal communications software, and video conferencing software have become powerful online communication tools that nonprofits have to inspire philanthropy, create awareness, and engage momentum for their mission and programs.</p>
<p>As nonprofits embrace digital transformations since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, long standing issues of the digital divide are illuminated. The matter is that many rural and low- income communities of the world lack reliable, affordable internet access. People who do not have connection to the internet are denied access to the benefits of technology as more devices and systems reliant on internet connectivity emerge. However, technology is meant to be an equalizing tool, not a source of division. Collective efforts are required to ensure universal digital accessibility.</p>

<p>As the world becomes further globalized, the number of international workers and volunteers in humanitarian work (remote teams) is on the rise. As well, greater numbers of local personnel are becoming involved with humanitarian organizations. The goal is to have international and local teams work together on their mission. The challenge, however, is navigating work between two remotely located teams. Technology tools can help facilitate communication and collaboration between remote teams. When using such tools, it is important that a) necessary resources are available to all workers, b) workers receive digital literacy training, and c) that communication tools are centralized.</p>
<p><strong>The Number of Remote Workers are Growing</strong></p>
<p>In recent years, the number of remote workers around the world has increased dramatically. According to Buffer’s <em>2020 State of Work Report</em>, 57% of those polled work from home 100% of the time. The increasing trend of remote workers has grown even more since the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>Remote working has shown its benefits and challenges. The three biggest benefits of working remotely indicated in <em>the 2020 State of Work Report</em> are the <strong>ability to have a flexible schedule</strong> (32%), <strong>flexibility to work from anywhere</strong> (26%), and <strong>not having to commute</strong> (21%). The three biggest struggles are c<strong>ollaboration and communication</strong> (20%), <strong>loneliness</strong> (20%), and <strong>not being able to unplug</strong> (18%). <strong>For international and local workers in remote settings, collaboration and communication is especially important but challenging.</strong></p></div>

<p>Technology tools can offer ways to create better collaboration and communication between remote workers. Internal communications software such as Slack and video conferencing software such as Zoom allow remote workers to connect. According to the <em>Remote Work Report</em> by Gitlab, the top three communication tools used by remote workers worldwide are <strong>video conferencing</strong> (63%), <strong>messaging and collaboration</strong> (55%), and <strong>phone and SMS</strong> (51%).</p></div>

						<div class="et_pb_blurb_description"><p>While technology tools can be helpful, they are only as good as how they are used. When using technology tools, it is important that a) necessary resources are available, b) workers are digitally literate, and c) that the same communication tools are used between workers and teams.</p>
<p><strong>Required Resources</strong></p>
<p>Technology tools require resources. This includes smartphones, computers or laptops, security software, and routers with high-speed internet. To some peoples these resources may be easily accessible. However, others may not have any access to them at all. A digital divide exists not only between developed and developing countries but also within countries. On <em>The Internet and the Pandemic</em> survey conducted by PEW Research Center, it has been found that in the U.S., 60% of broadband users with lower incomes often or sometimes have connection problems, and 46% are worried at least some about paying for broadband. It is thus, important for organizations to equip workers with the resources and accommodations required to use technology tools.</p></div>

						<div class="et_pb_blurb_description"><p><strong>Digital Literacy</strong></p>
<p>According to the <em>Virtual Teams Survey</em> by Culture Wizard, only 22% of global respondents reported to have received formal training in virtual communication and 24% reported that their companies provide virtual team charters or guidelines. However, this knowledge support is incredibly important in bridging the gap in digital literacy. People with higher levels of digital literacy are more likely to use technology tools more effectively and efficiently, whereas people with low levels of digital literacy are more likely to be left out. Therefore, organizations need to invest more in conducting digital training to their workers.</p>
<p><strong>Standardized Communication Tools</strong></p>
<p>As much as technology offers many different tools to communicate, it also has risks for miscommunication. When multiple different communication tools are used by team members, it becomes difficult to track which tools are being used by whom. In the <em>Remote Work Report</em> produced by Gitlab, 37% of respondents indicated that they believe teams using different tools and services creates silos in the workplace. It is thus, important that communication tools are centralized between workers. Within the centralized communication tools, team members can voice their opinions, share updates, ask questions, and collaborate more effectively.</p>

						<div class="et_pb_blurb_description"><p><a href="https://clever.com/">Clever</a>, an ed-tech company, surveyed around 1500 teachers/administrators at the end of 2021 and found an evident discrepancy in the types of educational technology tools that school administrators and teachers select. As such, educators want more say in the selection of tools being offered.</p>
<p>As professors and kids return to in-person school, a report suggests that around 90% of educators will continue to use and implement the technological tools put in place during the pandemic. This is a significant statistic as it shows that they rely on and find technology compelling in the classroom. Among the report by Clever, for teachers, the top 3 reasons for using technology were:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Allowing students to work at their own pace</li>
<li>Supporting student engagement (e.g., through gamification)</li>
<li>Using data from students to understand progress</li>
</ol></div>

						<div class="et_pb_blurb_description"><p>Interestingly, administrators were more likely than educators to agree that the district has a wide array of high-quality tools. 85% of administrators somewhat or strongly agreed that their district has high-quality tools, compared to 68% of teachers. Similarly, 84% of administrators somewhat or strongly agreed that their district offers a sufficient range of resources to meet teacher needs, while 70% of professors said the same.</p>
<p>As well, while most teachers are somewhat satisfied by the tools offered through their district, 46% of them say they frequently bring other digital tools into the classroom. Building off of this point, over 60% feel left out in determining which tools to utilize within the classroom, with 33% stating that their voices are never heard.</p></div>

						<div class="et_pb_blurb_description"><p>These statistics demonstrate how under-appreciated teachers feel when it comes to selecting edtech tools for the classroom. With them utilizing technology more and more within the classroom, it is apparent that they have more say in the selection of tools being used. After all, they are the ones utilizing it to teach the children.</p>
